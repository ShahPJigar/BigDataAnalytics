Automated Data Cleaning

Steps to run project:-
1. Create new  eclipse project
2. Test the queries by running the files as Java Application

Project Details:-

Please do a text analylysis (using workflows) of the following transcript about the second debate between Trump and Hillary.

You will write a program P.java to extract information from: 
http://www.cs.wayne.edu/~shiyong/transcript2.html

Q2: calculate the number of words spoken by Trump, Clinton, RADDATZ, and Cooper, respectively.

For Q3, Q4, Q5, please exclude stop words (the, an, a, is, am, are): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words

Please do not copy the file to your local. You need to extract this file programmatically (do the data cleaning using your program.)
This kind of programming is called "automated data cleaning", very important for big data analytics.
